# Synthetic Motion Profiles Integration

This document describes the integration of synthetic basketball motion profiles with the existing mobile app and backend.

## üèÄ Overview

The synthetic motion profiles system has been successfully integrated with the existing `mobile-app-integrated` branch. This integration allows users to:

1. **Select NBA Players**: Choose from 5 NBA player styles (LeBron, Curry, Durant, Kawhi, Harden)
2. **Compare Shooting Form**: Record videos and compare them with synthetic player data
3. **Get Detailed Analysis**: Receive phase-by-phase similarity scores and recommendations
4. **View Results**: See comprehensive comparison results with visual feedback

## üì± Mobile App Integration

### New Screens Added

1. **PlayerSelectionScreen** (`mobile/src/screens/PlayerSelectionScreen.jsx`)
   - Displays all 5 NBA player options
   - Shows player characteristics and descriptions
   - Allows user to select a player for comparison

2. **Updated CameraScreen** (`mobile/src/screens/CameraScreen.jsx`)
   - Shows selected player information during recording
   - Sends player data to backend for comparison
   - Supports both basic analysis and player comparison modes

3. **Updated ResultsScreen** (`mobile/src/screens/ResultsScreen.jsx`)
   - Displays overall similarity score
   - Shows phase-by-phase breakdown
   - Provides player comparison details
   - Includes recommendations for improvement

### Navigation Flow

```
LandingScreen
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "Compare with NBA Players" ‚Üí PlayerSelectionScreen
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Select Player ‚Üí CameraScreen (with player data)
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Record Video ‚Üí ResultsScreen (with comparison)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ "Basic Analysis" ‚Üí CameraScreen (basic mode)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Record Video ‚Üí ResultsScreen (basic results)
```

### Configuration

- **Config File**: `mobile/src/utils/config.js`
  - Backend endpoints
  - Player definitions
  - Similarity thresholds
  - Helper functions

## üîß Backend Integration

### New Endpoints

1. **`POST /analysis/compare-with-player`**
   - Compares user video with selected player
   - Returns similarity scores and recommendations

2. **`GET /synthetic/player-profiles`**
   - Returns available player profiles
   - Includes player characteristics and metadata

3. **`POST /synthetic/generate-profile`**
   - Generates synthetic profile for specific player
   - Returns motion data in JSON format

### Integration with Existing Backend

- **Main App**: `backend/main.py` includes synthetic routes
- **Existing Routes**: Model and LLM routes remain unchanged
- **CORS**: Configured to allow mobile app access
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when synthetic profiles unavailable

### Synthetic Profiles System

- **Location**: `synthetic_profiles/motion_profile_generator.py`
- **Players**: 5 NBA player styles with unique characteristics
- **Phases**: 6 shooting phases (General, Set-up, Loading, Rising, Release, Follow-through)
- **Data Format**: JSON with keypoints, ball positions, and confidence scores

## üéØ Player Styles

| Player | Style | Characteristics | Frame Count |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| LeBron James | Power | Explosive motion, strong follow-through | 90 |
| Stephen Curry | Quick | Fast release, smooth motion flow | 85 |
| Kevin Durant | Smooth | High release point, very consistent | 85 |
| Kawhi Leonard | Linear | Controlled motion, deliberate form | 88 |
| James Harden | Smooth | Step-back specialist, unique rhythm | 87 |

## üöÄ Usage

### Starting the Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Starting the Mobile App

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npx expo start
```

### Testing the Integration

1. **Backend Health Check**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

2. **Get Player Profiles**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/synthetic/player-profiles
   ```

3. **Generate Player Profile**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/synthetic/generate-profile \
     -F "player_id=curry"
   ```

## üìä Analysis Results

The system provides:

- **Overall Similarity**: Percentage match with selected player
- **Phase Scores**: Individual scores for each shooting phase
- **Recommendations**: Specific improvement suggestions
- **Comparison Metrics**: Motion consistency, release timing, follow-through

### Similarity Thresholds

- **Excellent**: ‚â•80% (Green)
- **Good**: ‚â•60% (Orange)
- **Fair**: ‚â•40% (Yellow)
- **Needs Improvement**: <40% (Red)

## üîÑ Data Flow

1. **User selects player** ‚Üí Mobile app stores player data
2. **User records video** ‚Üí Video uploaded to backend with player info
3. **Backend processes** ‚Üí Analyzes video and loads synthetic profile
4. **Comparison executed** ‚Üí Calculates similarity scores
5. **Results returned** ‚Üí Mobile app displays analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Mobile App
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Navigation**: React Navigation Stack
- **Camera**: Expo Camera for video recording
- **API**: Axios for backend communication

### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Synthetic Data**: Custom motion profile generator
- **Analysis**: Integration with existing basketball analysis pipeline
- **Caching**: In-memory cache for synthetic profiles

### Synthetic Profiles
- **Language**: Python
- **Dependencies**: NumPy, SciPy
- **Output**: JSON format with normalized coordinates
- **Features**: Noise simulation, motion curves, phase distribution

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- **More Players**: Additional NBA player profiles
- **Custom Profiles**: User-generated motion profiles
- **Real-time Feedback**: Live coaching during recording
- **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning-based insights
- **Social Features**: Share and compare with friends

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Synthetic Profiles Not Available**
   - Check if `synthetic_profiles` directory exists
   - Verify Python dependencies are installed
   - Check import paths in backend

2. **Mobile App Can't Connect**
   - Verify backend URL in `config.js`
   - Check CORS settings
   - Ensure backend is running

3. **Video Upload Fails**
   - Check file size limits
   - Verify video format (MP4)
   - Check network connectivity

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test synthetic profiles
cd synthetic_profiles
python3 -c "from motion_profile_generator import SyntheticProfileGenerator, create_curry_style; g = SyntheticProfileGenerator(); p = g.generate_profile(create_curry_style()); print(f'Generated {len(p)} frames')"

# Test backend
cd backend
python3 -c "from main import app; print('Backend loaded successfully')"
```
